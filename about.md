# About

I am a student at UQ studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science majoring in Machine Learning. I have experience with languages including python, C, Java, Javascript, HTML, SQL and assembly. I am on track to graduate in 2027 with my Dual degree.\
\
My interests in computer science lie in optimisation problems and I have experience creating genetic algorithms, MILP algorithms and investigating optimisation through copying biological animal behaviours (such as ant colonies). \
\
I am currently working on learning how to implement machine learning in parallel to optimisation problems to reduce the time complexity of algorithms and the accuracy of the solutions.\
\
I currently have an internship at ARUP in the renewable energy engineering team where I have worked on optimisation problems for offshore wind farm cable layouts and running simulations for Solar farm grid connection studies. \
