# Moving a public Fork into a Private Repo
Git is my best of friend but at times it is also my worst enemy until I figure it out again. Setting up my own repo was a bit frustating as when you clone from 
Brian's Repo you can't just move it into your own private repo. After being stumped with this, with the help of a tutor and the legend Brian himself, we forked off the cloned
repo which created a forked repo in my own git. Unfortunately this is public which left an uneasy feeling of submitting my assessment code 
to the world while plagarism is so highly convicted.

Using [Method 1 in Brian's blog](https://lovellbrian.github.io/2025/03/23/private.html) I managed to make my repo private finally so that I'm no longer in danger of
plagarism!! Yippy!!

My repo for Assignment 1 is now (here)[https://github.com/kaylamalherbe/fingerprint]

The instructions are as below:
Choose a repository in lovellbrian from GitHUB (https://github.com/lovellbrian). Click on fork. Unclick Copy the master branch only, then click on Create Fork. Now you will be placed in your fork of my repository. Your fork is set to Public access which is against UQ policy for Assignments and may lead to misconduct proceedings.

What you really need is to convert this to a Private Fork. Click on Settings and scroll down until you see the Danger Zone in red. Click on Leave Fork Network. Now select Change Visibility and Change to Private. You have now converted your Public repository to Private which is fine for assignment submissions.
