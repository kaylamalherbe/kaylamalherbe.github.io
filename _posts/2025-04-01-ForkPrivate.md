# Moving a public Fork into a Private Repo
Git is my best of friend but at times it is also my worst enemy until I figure it out again. Setting up my own repo was a bit frustating as when you clone from 
Brian's Repo you can't just move it into your own private repo. After being stumped with this, with the help of a tutor and the legend Brian himself, we forked off the cloned
repo which created a forked repo in my own git. Unfortunately this is public which left an uneasy feeling of submitting my assessment code 
to the world while plagarism is so highly convicted./

Using [Method 1 in Brian's blog](https://lovellbrian.github.io/2025/03/23/private.html) I managed to make my repo private finally so that I'm no longer in danger of
plagarism!!/ Yippy!!/

My repo for Assignment 1 is now (here)[https://github.com/kaylamalherbe/fingerprint]
