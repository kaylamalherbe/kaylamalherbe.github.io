# ROC Curves
ROC stands for Receiver Operating Characteristic and is a tool used to analyse classifiers (typically binary where it can have a True or False outcome).
The Curve is a graph with the rate of true positives vs the rate of false positives.
This may sound like it doesn't account for false negatives and true positives but the equation for finding these rates uses all these variables. See below:

## To calculate true and false positives:
### True Positive Rate (TPR)

$$ True Positives = TP $$
$$ False Negatives = FN $$
$$ TPR = \frac{TP}{TP + FN} $$

A high TPR is desirable

### False Positive Rate (FPR)

$$ True Negatives = TN $$
$$ False Positive = FP $$
$$ TPR = \frac{FP}{FP + TN} $$

A low FPR is desirable

## ROC Plot
Use the following import to calculate FPR, TRP and thresholds
````
sklearn.metrics.roc_curve
````

The plot is a good visual tool but to numerically analyse the tool you can use the area under the curve as a metric. This is calculated using the following  import:
````
sklearn.metrics.auc
````
An area of 1 means the model is perfect and an area of 0.5 means the model is totally random.
