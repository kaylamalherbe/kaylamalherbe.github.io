# t-SNE
t-SNE stands for T-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding.

The basic functionality of t-sne is that it takes a higher dimensional set and reduces it to a lower dimension and then uses stochastic nearest neighbor to project the data in the lower dimension into its clusters. AKA it finds the distance of a point from every other point and maps it on a distribution graph to get the similarity between points. Important notes are that when finding the distances between each point it plots it on a t distribution graph because if it was on a normalised distribution graph the distance points have very low similarity values which is useless for the projection.
