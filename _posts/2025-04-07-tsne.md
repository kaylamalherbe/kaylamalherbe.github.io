# t-SNE

Contents:


## Definition
t-SNE stands for T-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding.

The basic functionality of t-sne is that it takes a higher dimensional set and reduces it to a lower dimension and then uses stochastic nearest neighbor to project the data in the lower dimension into its clusters. AKA it finds the distance of a point from every other point and maps it on a distribution graph to get the similarity between points. Important notes are that when finding the distances between each point it plots it on a t distribution graph because if it was on a normalised distribution graph the distance points have very low similarity values which is useless for the projection. 

## t-sne in python
Required imports:
```
from fastai.vision.all import *
from sklearn.manifold import TSNE
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import pandas as pd
```

[See here for the t-SNE sklearn.manifold documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.manifold.TSNE.html)

### Important Parameters
1. n_compoenets

2. Perplexity

3. Random State Number


Assuming you have already created the dls and run the learn and fine_tune functions, extract the reduced dimensions:
```
dl = learn.dls.valid  # or use learn.dls.test_dl() for custom data
features = []
labels = []

# Forward pass to get activations
for xb, yb in dl:
    with torch.no_grad():
        output = learn.model(xb)
        features.append(output.cpu())
        labels.extend(yb.cpu().numpy())

# Stack feature vectors
features = torch.cat(features).numpy()
label_mapping = {i: c for i, c in enumerate(learn.dls.vocab)}
```

Calling TSNE and adding it to a dataframe

```
tsne = TSNE(n_components=2, perplexity=i, random_state=42)
tsne_result = tsne.fit_transform(features)

df = pd.DataFrame()
df['tsne-2d-one'] = tsne_result[:,0]
df['tsne-2d-two'] = tsne_result[:,1]
df['label'] = labels
df['label_name'] = [label_mapping[i] for i in labels]

```

Creating plot
```
plt.figure(figsize=(10,7))
    sns.scatterplot(
        x='tsne-2d-one', y='tsne-2d-two',
        hue='label_name',
        palette=sns.color_palette("hsv", len(set(labels))),
        data=df,
        legend="full",
        alpha=0.7
    )

    plt.legend(
        title="Classes",
        bbox_to_anchor=(1.05, 1),
        loc='upper left',
        borderaxespad=0.
    )

    plt.title("t-SNE of Multiclass Fastai Learner, , perplexity=" + str(i))
    plt.show()
```
